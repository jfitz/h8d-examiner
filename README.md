# h8d-examiner
Read disk image files from Heathkit 8-bit computers (H-8, H-89).

h8d-examiner can read the data in H8D files, which are images of HDOS and CP/M disks from Heathkit H-17 formats.

Interactive mode

h8d-examiner can 'mount' a disk image and the user can dump individual sectors (in hex or octal), list files,
view the contents of files, and export files to the local file system. Files may be text or binary. 

Batch mode

h8d-examiner can list files and export a file from the command line, with no interaction.
