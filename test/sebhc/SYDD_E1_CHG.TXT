Corrections to transcription of SYDD rom source.

It turns out that I used Peter's version of SYDD.ASM as my source.  I
compiled ith source on my H89 and then compared the resultant .ABS
file (after the 8 byte header) with the ROM installed in the machine.
The comparison pointed out several mis-matches.  Some stemmed from 
transcription errors, (MOV A,H instead of MOV A,M).  Others came from things
like typing DS where EQU should have been, etc.

Based on the SYDD.ASM source as downloaded on Sunday evening, August 30, the
following corrections are needed.

====================
    DEFINITIONS:
====================
Directory entry format area:
   After the line DIR.LGN DS  1 insert a line DIR.LSI DS  1.

Active I/O area, the line AIO.DDA:
	AIO.DDA DS	*-2
 should read:
	AIO.DDA EQU	*-2
-------------------
Device Driver Delayed load flags, the line S.DDGRP:
	S.DDGRP	DS	2
		DS	2
 should read:
	S.DDGRP DS	1
		DS	1
-------------------
Same area, the line
	S.DDOPC	DS	2
 should read:
	S.DDOPC	DS	1

====================
   ACTIVE CODE:
====================
Routine MEM3, second instruction should be  MOV A,M v. MOV A,H

Routine $COMP, second instruction should be CMP M,  v. CMP H

Routine $HLIHL, third instruction should be MOV H,M v. MOV H,L

Routine $TJMP., third instruction should be CALL $DATA. v. CALL $DADA (needs
	trailing '.')

Routine LDO, 18th instruction (just after the Must dump (HL) comment
	should be PUSH  D v. PUSH B

Routine READ6, 16th instruction (just after the ERRNZ line)
	should be JNE  READ2.4 v. JNE  READ2,4 ('dot' v. 'comma')

Routine LPS2, third instruction should be JNZ LPS1 v. JNC LPS1

Hope this is useful.
